Info:
 
This package is about assignment1_brief, using html5,css and javascript.
It includes: 10 html pages :
-Courses.html ,
-Trainers.html ,
-Students.html ,
-Assignment.html ,
-TrainersPerCourse.html ,
-StudentsPerCourse.html ,
-AssignmentsPerCourse.html,
-AssignmentsPerStudentPerCourse.html ,
-Home.html ,
-About.html .

It also includes a css file called: 
-MyStyleAssigment1.css

Moreover it includes 2 extra files for a library that is being used called:
-alertify.min.css
-alertify.min.js
These files are needed for using alertify for custom pop up messages that are used for the validation.

Finaly there is a 'img' folder, having all the needed images for the project.

How to use:

You can open any of the html pages and the package will work. 
I suggest for having better experience to open the page: Home.html .
From that page you can traverse through the whole functionality of all pages, 
in a more compulsive way, using either the navbar at the top of the page or the image links you will find into home page.
